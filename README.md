# wildwest
A quickdraw game made in 16bit DOS assembly, set approximately at the time they should've stopped teaching assembly in schools.

## Assembling and running
The game should be assembled using Turbo Assembler in DOSBOX.

Run the exe by typing 'wildwest' in DOSBOX.

The BMP files should reside in the same folder you run wildwest.exe from.


## Playing
Navigate the main menu using the arrow keys and Enter to select an action.

One player uses the up arrow key while another uses W.

Both players compete to be the first shot after the 'SHOOT' signal is displayed.

Shooting before you're allowed to will result in losing the round.
